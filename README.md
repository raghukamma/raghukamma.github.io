## My Portfolio

This is my personal website! The website tells about myself, previous work experiences and projects. I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for building this website.

## Deployed Site:

My portfolio website is deployed by GitHub pages at: https://raghukamma.github.io

## How to run the code:

My portfoio is built on a single webpage and it has multiple sections on the same page.
Hence, to see the portfolio webpage, simply upen the index.html on any commonly used web browsers i.e., Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.

## How my website has been built:

I've built this webpage using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
Only since CSS & JavaScript files were created for this application since the webpage is a single page and hence it was easy to maintain while buildng the webpage.

I did not any additional folder structure. All my files are located in the root directory including images. This simplicity helped in building this webpage under 12 hours.

Below is my repository structure and how the files are called in the index.html:
