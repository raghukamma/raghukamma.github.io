      <h3>Hi there !</h3>

      <h1>I'm <span>Raghu Kamma.</span></h1>
      <p>
        I help build world class products at the AI Solutions Business Unit of
        Skyworks. Writing algorithms and working with large data sets to train
        those algorithms have been an interesting part of my job for the past
        couple of years. I am a hardware and firmware designer. Being familiar
        with both the hardware and software allows me to design both to work
        together seamlessly. I also lead compliance efforts for various audio
        solutions - host stacks, applications, integrated circuits designed for
        mixed signal solutions. <br /><br />
        As a Project Manager, I manage cost, schedule, scope, risk, stakeholder,
        communication, integration, quality, resource, and procurement.
        Successfully delivered ~20 audio products as a project manager within
        the planned cost and schedule over the last 9 years of my professional
        career. Results oriented engineer and a manager with broad engineering
        and business experience and a proven record of business achievements.
        Accomplishment of business objectives through recognized leadership of
        technical and business personnel and development / coaching of
        collaborative teams. Interested in New Product Line Development, Product
        Strategy, Organizational Development, Artificial Intelligence, and
        Machine Learning. <br /><br />
        I am currently upskilling my AI & ML skills in the Computer Science
        department at the Portland State.

          <h3>Infotainment Systems</h3>
          <p>
            Played a small part in building a wireless audio solution in an
            infotainment system to General Motors that went into millions of
            vehicles/year for almost 6 years. I used to write code to implement
            features, validate the functionality of the audio solution, fixing
            bugs, managing team and budget for audio solutions component etc.
            Helping write test automation frameworks, using robotics for test
            automation was a fun part of this project.

          <h3>Wireless Key for vehicles</h3>
          <p>
            Played a key role in a small team that implemented a wireless key
            solution for automotive vehicles based on Bluetooth Low Energy
            technology. This product uses Bluetooth Low Energy on Smartphones +
            Vehicles and unlocks the vehicle doors when the user is near the
            vehicle. That solution went into millions of vehicles released by a
            few OEMs. For obvious reasons, I can't name the OEMs.

          <h3>True Wireless Stereo Earpods & Headsets</h3>
          <p>
            Helping build a True Wireless Stereo (TWS) audio solution that goes
            into earpods, headsets, gaming consoles etc. maufactured by many
            OEMs. This solution creates two seperate audio links between the
            smartphones and headsets (unlike many in the market today that are
            not true TWS solutions). I am solving challenging engineering
            problems everyday and are delivering low latency in these headsets.
